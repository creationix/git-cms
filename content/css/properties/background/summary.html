  <p>This background property is a shorthand property for setting the color, position, size, repeat, clip, origin, attachment, and image of the element.</p>

  <p>The background- properties provide fundamental styles to an element, such as color, image, and position. CSS3 adds more properties for handling backgrounds, including properties that improve the mobile web experience. Many CSS background properties can be set, at the same time, with this background property.</p>
