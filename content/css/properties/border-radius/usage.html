    As with any shorthand property, individual inherited values are not possible, that is <code>border-radius:0 0 inherit inherit</code>, which would override existing definitions partially. In that case, the individual longhand properties have to be used.

    <code>border-radius</code> can take between one and four values:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>one value will be applied to all four corners
    </li>
    <li>two values will be applied to top-left + bottom-right, and top-right + bottom-left, respectively
    </li>
    <li>three values will be applied to top-left, top-right + bottom-left, and bottom-right, respectively
    </li>
    <li>four values will be applied to the four corners separately, in the order of top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>The <b>border-radius</b> property is a composite property that specifies up to four <b>border-*-radius</b> properties. If values are given before and after the slash, the values before the slash set the horizontal radius and the values after the slash set the vertical radius. If there is no slash, the values set both radii equally. The four values for each radii are given in clockwise order, starting from the top left corner. If less than four values are provided, they are repeated until we get four values, similarly to other CSS properties, such as border-width.
    </li>
    <li>Itâ€™s possible to end up with elliptical corners, even by specifying one radius. This occurs when you are using percentages, since they resolve to a different number for each axis (horizontally they are percentages of the border box width, vertically of the height). For a demonstration, refer to the ellipse example above (example #3)
    </li>
    <li>Since border-radius rounds the border box of the element, the inner (padding box) corners will have smaller radii (specifically border-radius - border-width), or even no rounding, if the border is thicker than the border-radius value. Another consequence of this is that when there are different border widths on adjacent sides, the curves of the padding box will be elliptical.
    </li>
    <li>Note that although in the border-radius shorthand, there is a slash (/) to separate horizontal from vertical radii, they are space separated in the longhands.
    </li>
