  <p>Quite often there are only a few weights available for a particular font family. When a weight is specified for which no face exists, a face with a nearby weight is used:<br>
    <b>600-900</b> use the closest available darker weight (or, if there is none, the closest available lighter weight).<br>
    <b>100-500</b> use the closest available lighter weight (or, if there is none, the closest available darker weight).<br>
    This means that for fonts that provide only normal and bold, <b>100-500</b> are normal, and <b>600-900</b> are bold.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the practice — also called “Faux bold” — is not well-loved by typographers, bold faces are often synthesized by user agents for faces that lack actual bold faces.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>100</b> to <b>900</b><br>
    These values form an ordered sequence, where each number indicates a weight that is at least as dark as its predecessor. These roughly correspond to the commonly used weight names below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>100</b> - Thin
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>200</b> - Extra Light (Ultra Light)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>300</b> - Light
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>400</b> - Normal
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>500</b> - Medium
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>600</b> - Semi Bold (Demi Bold)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>700</b> - Bold
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>800</b> - Extra Bold (Ultra Bold)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>900</b> - Black (Heavy)
    </li>
  </ul>
