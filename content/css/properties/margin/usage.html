      <code>margin</code> can take 1-4 values for its value, including CSS length units, percentage values, or the keywords <b>auto</b> or <b>inherit</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>If one value is given, it applies to all four sides.
        </li>
        <li>If two values are given, the first applies to the top and bottom, the second applies to the right and left.
        </li>
        <li>If three values are given, the first applies to the top, the second applies to the right and left sides, and the third applies to the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>If four values are given, they are applied in clockwise order, starting from the top (top, right, bottom, left).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Negative margins are supported except for top and bottom margins on inline objects.
    </li>
    <li>When two margins collide, for example when one block level element has a bottom margin set, immediately followed by another block level element with a top margin, the larger of the two margins remains, and the smaller one collapses and disappears.
    </li>
    <li>Margins are always transparent.
    </li>
  </ul>
